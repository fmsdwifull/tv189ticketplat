/// \brief A plugin to provide a simple way to compress and incrementally send the files in the FileList structure.
/// \details Similar to the DirectoryDeltaTransfer plugin, except that it doesn't send deltas based on pre-existing files or actually write the files to disk.
///
/// Usage:
/// Call SetupReceive to allow one file set to arrive.  The value returned by FileListTransfer::SetupReceive()
/// is the setID that is allowed.
/// It's up to you to transmit this value to the other system, along with information indicating what kind of files you want to get.
/// The other system should then prepare a FileList and call FileListTransfer::Send(), passing the return value of FileListTransfer::SetupReceive()
/// as the \a setID parameter to FileListTransfer::Send()
